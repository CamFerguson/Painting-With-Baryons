  6. Best results from dm -> gas

  9. 
  10. First run on pressure with Troster dataloader,
      - range compress transform
      - this run accidentally did not implement the decaying learning rate
  11. Split scale + range compress transform (not in that order
  12. same as 11 with large batch sized and smaller lr
  13. Redo of {11, 12} with exponential lr decay now implemented 
  14. FCS summer transform used
      - k=4 has a harsh decay for the pressure
  15. like '14' but with seperate k values for fields
      1. k=9
      2. k=9 slower lr
      3. k=0.5
  16. Redo of 10
      1. with exponential deacy
      2. same as #1 but with 10 iters for decay
      3. now using Troster range compress
  17. meta resnet
      1. split frequency then transform to [-1, 1]
